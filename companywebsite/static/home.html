            At Tally, we believe in the power of technology to make business
            owners efficient, empowered and happier, so they can focus on what
            matters most for their business. We design our products to focus on
            just that to make our products work for you, and not the other way
            around.
            <br />
            Our new product TallyPrime takes this to a new level, making your
            start to automation, or your switch to Tally simpler than ever
            before. You can now discover the product much more easily and make
            the product do more for you, without learning anything new. There is
            greater flexibility as the product adapts to your business and your
            way of working. And the transformed look and feel will only make you
            love the product even more.
